## üìù Coding Standards

### C/C++ Code Style

Follow these guidelines for Arduino and STM32 code:

#### Naming Conventions

```cpp
// Constants: UPPER_CASE
#define MAX_SPEED_MM_S  1000
const int PULSE_PIN = 9;

// Variables: camelCase
int pulseFrequency = 250000;
bool limitFwdTriggered = false;

// Functions: camelCase
void moveForward(int distance);
bool checkLimitSwitch();

// Enums: PascalCase with PREFIX_
enum MotionState {
    STATE_IDLE,
    STATE_MOVING_FORWARD,
    STATE_MOVING_REVERSE
};

// Classes: PascalCase
class ServoController {
    // ...
};
```

#### Code Formatting

```cpp
// Indentation: 4 spaces (no tabs)
void myFunction() {
    if (condition) {
        doSomething();
    }
}

// Braces: K&R style
if (x > 0) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}

// Comments: Clear and concise
// Single-line comment

/*
 * Multi-line comment
 * for complex explanations
 */

/**
 * @brief Function documentation
 * @param distance Distance in millimeters
 * @return True if successful
 */
bool moveForward(int distance);
```

#### Best Practices

```cpp
// Use const for constants
const int LED_PIN = 13;

// Use constexpr for compile-time constants
constexpr int BUFFER_SIZE = 256;

// Avoid magic numbers
// Bad
delay(100);

// Good
const int DEBOUNCE_DELAY_MS = 100;
delay(DEBOUNCE_DELAY_MS);

// Use meaningful variable names
// Bad
int x, y, z;

// Good
int currentPosition, targetPosition, positionError;

// Check return values
if (setupTimer1PWM() != SUCCESS) {
    handleError();
}

// Initialize variables
int counter = 0;  // Good
int value;        // Bad - uninitialized
```

### Python Code Style

For utility tools:

```python
# Follow PEP 8
# Use 4 spaces for indentation
# Maximum line length: 79 characters

def calculate_pulse_frequency(speed_mm_s, pulses_per_mm):
    """
    Calculate required pulse frequency.
    
    Args:
        speed_mm_s: Linear speed in mm/s
        pulses_per_mm: Encoder pulses per millimeter
        
    Returns:
        Pulse frequency in Hz
    """
    return speed_mm_s * pulses_per_mm
```

   - Maximum speed
   - Limit switch triggers
   - Emergency stop
   - Parameter changes

### Simulation Testing

If you don't have hardware:

1. **Verify code compiles** on target platform
2. **Run static analysis** if available
